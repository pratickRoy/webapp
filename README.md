# The Story

I - The Context

So, let’s start with the story. Now it’s not surprising that a techie would like to have a personal website. 
However, we engineers’ have another common trait. Procrastination. So, this section is essentially about the impetus 
that got me into motion. Recently I started to write again. Almost every weekend, I pour in a few hours for the same. 
I don’t know if I will be able to hold onto this in the future, but at least I have been able to keep at it for the last
few months. As I wrote more, I started to see an issue. Not with what I wrote, but with the way I was distributing it. 
If you have read anything I wrote in the recent past, you will know that I mostly write in Medium. And, It’s a great 
website for content creation. It has its own native audience & aids in curation and distribution, and brings in far 
more eyeballs to my posts, than I could have managed on an insular blog. A while back I wrote two technical posts, 
Good Code & Are Void Methods bad? If you google for them, at least at the time of creating this video they rank at the 
top. This amount of SEO Optimization comes out of the box, allowing me to simply concentrate on the writing bit. 
So, all this is great, but it comes with a caveat. For Medium to work its magic, the story must be put behind a paywall.
Now I don’t particularly have any problem with this. Paywalls are a sustainable business model. Medium is a business, 
it has bills to pay, and investors to satisfy. It can’t run on goodwill. And if it didn’t put a paywall, it would need 
to generate revenue with advertising. Not only would that lead to clickbait articles, but also medium would need to 
track your every move in order to make a profit. While you read an article, it would read you, and use that information 
to sell you adds. On the other hand, with a subscription, you become a paying customer, and consequently you can assert 
your rights with conviction. OTT platforms like Netflix and Prime Video do this, and I fully endorse it. 
And I endorse Medium doing it as well. 

II - The Problem

My problem is applying subscriptions to the kind of content I want and hope to create, for the entire point of anything 
I write, is to give you something to take away, think over, and use your brain to accept, reject or form your own 
notions about what I had to say. I make a concerted effort to not be didactic, as I hate being preached to, and I 
assume the same goes for you as well, but nevertheless, a good chuck of what I have written, and what I hope to 
continue writing is educational in nature, and while it’s one thing to paywall entertainment, it’s quite another to 
paywall education. Apart from the principle, it’s also personal. When I was in school and college, I used to devour 
educational content on the internet. It was a window into the world that has personally helped me grow into a person 
that I quite like. I understand that many people who know me personally would roll their eyes at this outrageous 
statement. To them I say, Shut Up. But honestly, if all educational content was paywalled, I would have been a far 
poorer man than I am today, and I am not speaking only financially. And while I know I won’t make any huge impact on 
many people, even if there is a slight chance that someone learns and grows as a result of reading my work, I wouldn’t 
want to deny them that same ladder that was offered to me. 

III - The Solution

Now a simple way to resolve this would be have my own space in the web, where I can collate both free and paid versions 
of my posts, and share that with the world. Anyone who is a medium member, loves the Medium reading experience, and can 
afford the subscription, can read the medium version. And if you like the content you see in the platform and you can 
afford it, I would highly encourage you to subscribe and support quality content. And if you can’t afford it, 
I’ll provide a free variant.
